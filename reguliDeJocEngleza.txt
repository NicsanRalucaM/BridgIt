connects two adjacent dots of his own color. Then the other player does
the same thing, connecting two adjacent dots of his color. 
They take turns doing this.
      The first player tries to form a continuous path of 
lines from the top row of his dots to the bottom row. 
The path does not have to be straight; it can twist in any way 
so long as it connects opposite sides of the board.
      The second player tries to form a similar path from the 
left column of his color to the right end. Each of course uses his 
lines for blocking the other player's path. 
      The first player to complete his path is the winner!
