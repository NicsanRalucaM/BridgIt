# BridgIt
Bridg-It is a simple connection board game. It is a two-player game and the board consists of two rectangular arrays of dots, one array for each player. The players move by alternately connecting two dots within their array to form a line or bridge. The objective for player one is to build a bridge from left to right and the objective for player two is to build a bridge from top to bottom. The player who is first to create a bridge that connects their opposite edges of the board, wins. The rules to play Bridg-It are as follows: players take turns connecting two adjacent dots of their own color with a bridge. Adjacent dots are considered to be dots directly above, below, to the right, or to the left of another dot with the same color. A newly formed bridge cannot cross a bridge already played and whoever connects their opposite edges of the board first wins. When broken down to the basics, Bridg-It is a game based off of graph theory. The element of graph theory that the game is concerned with is disjoint spanning trees.
